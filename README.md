    HTML Structure Reflection: 
        The HTML was used to define the layout of the game interface, including the player inputs, buttons, and scoreboard, structured with semantic tags like <nav>, <footer>, and <div>. An improvement would be to use more semantic elements like <section> and <article> to enhance accessibility and improve SEO.

    CSS and Bootstrap Styling: 
        CSS and Bootstrap were utilized to create a responsive design with consistent styling, using Bootstrapâ€™s grid system and custom CSS for a maroon-themed aesthetic. One improvement would be to enhance visual hierarchy by adjusting spacing and typography for better readability and user flow.

    JavaScript for Interactivity: 
        JavaScript was implemented to manage player interactions, such as starting the game, handling answers, and updating scores. An enhancement could be adding visual feedback (animations or transitions) when players buzz in or submit answers, improving the user experience.

    PHP and MySQL Integration: 
        PHP was used to handle game data like player scores, while MySQL stored game results and leaderboard data. One improvement would be optimizing database queries by using prepared statements to improve security and performance.
