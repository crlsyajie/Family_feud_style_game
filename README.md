### HTML Structure Reflection:
The HTML structure forms the foundation of our Family Feud game, outlining the layout and organizing the various game components like player input fields, buttons, and the scoreboard. By using semantic tags such as `<nav>` for navigation and `<footer>` for page-end information, we created a logical flow for the game's interface. `<div>` tags were used to group related sections, maintaining a structured and clean design. However, we recognize that introducing additional semantic elements like `<section>` for content blocks and `<article>` for individual game components would improve both accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO). These tags provide more meaning to the structure, making it easier for assistive technologies and search engines to interpret the content. By making these adjustments, we could not only enhance the game’s usability for all users but also ensure that the code remains clean and scalable for future developments.

### CSS and Bootstrap Styling:
To style the game, we combined Bootstrap’s responsive grid system with custom CSS to create a cohesive, maroon-themed design. Bootstrap simplified the process of aligning elements and ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes, making the user experience consistent on both desktop and mobile devices. Custom CSS was used to tailor specific aspects like colors, fonts, and button styles, helping the game maintain a unique look while leveraging Bootstrap’s utility classes. Despite the success of this approach, there is room for improvement, particularly in terms of visual hierarchy. Refining the spacing between elements and enhancing typography would improve readability and guide users through the interface more naturally. For example, increasing the contrast between headings, text, and buttons would draw attention to key game components, enhancing the user’s interaction with the game and making it easier to navigate.

### JavaScript for Interactivity:
The interactive elements of the game are powered by JavaScript, which handles crucial functions such as starting the game, managing player turns, and updating scores in real time. JavaScript enables the dynamic functionality required for the game to run smoothly, including features like the buzzer system, timer, and player input. This ensures that the game responds immediately to user actions, creating an engaging and seamless experience. While the game mechanics work well, the user experience could be further enriched by incorporating visual feedback, such as animations or transitions when players buzz in or submit answers. Adding these effects would make the game feel more polished and immersive, heightening the sense of excitement as players compete. For instance, animated scoreboards or flashing lights during buzzer moments would provide satisfying feedback and enhance the game's overall aesthetic appeal.

### PHP and MySQL Integration:
On the backend, PHP is responsible for managing the flow of data between the game and the MySQL database, where player names, scores, and timestamps are stored. This allows for a functional leaderboard that displays results in descending order based on when the game was completed. The database setup ensures that game data is persistent and can be retrieved at any time, making it easy for players to view past results. However, the security and performance of this system could be improved by implementing prepared statements in the PHP code. Prepared statements would prevent SQL injection attacks, enhancing the security of user input. Additionally, optimizing database queries could reduce load times and improve the overall performance of the game, especially as the volume of data increases over time. Addressing XAMPP server issues, such as bugs related to starting and stopping services, would also improve the reliability of the development environment, minimizing downtime and ensuring smoother operation during testing and deployment.

### Sources:
Throughout the development of the Family Feud game, we relied on a variety of resources to guide us through the challenges we encountered. YouTube tutorials provided practical demonstrations for structuring the game’s logic, while Stack Overflow and W3Schools were essential for troubleshooting specific coding issues related to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Additionally, OpenAI’s ChatGPT Gemini served as an invaluable tool for problem-solving, helping us to refine our code and optimize the integration of different technologies. These sources collectively contributed to the successful completion of the project, enabling us to build a robust and interactive game that meets our initial design goals.
