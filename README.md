### HTML Structure Reflection:
    The HTML defined the layout of the game interface, including player inputs, buttons, and the scoreboard. We used semantic tags such as `<nav>`, `<footer>`, and `<div>`. However, using more semantic elements like `<section>` and `<article>` could further improve accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).

### CSS and Bootstrap Styling:
    We leveraged CSS and Bootstrap to create a responsive, maroon-themed design, utilizing Bootstrapâ€™s grid system along with custom CSS for consistency. One improvement could be enhancing the visual hierarchy by refining spacing and typography, improving readability and user flow.

### JavaScript for Interactivity:
    JavaScript managed the interactive elements, such as starting the game, handling answers, and updating scores. To improve user experience, we could add visual feedback like animations or transitions when players buzz in or submit answers.

### PHP and MySQL Integration:
    PHP handled game data, including player scores, while MySQL stored results and leaderboard data. One area for improvement would be optimizing database queries using prepared statements to enhance security and performance. Additionally, addressing the recurring XAMPP server issues, like bugs related to starting and stopping, would improve reliability.
